ACES Look Transforms, or Look Modification Transforms (LMTs), provide a
mechasnism for applying creative or stylistic adjustments to ACES images. A Look
Transform modifies the default appearance produced by an Output Transform,
enabling customized looks that can be reused as alterative starting points on
ACES projects.

Formally, LMTs are defined as ACES-to-ACES transformations, though intermediate
encodings may be used internally when specific color operations require it. In
the process diagram, the output of an LMT is referred to as ACES' ("ACES
prime"), which is subsequently processed Output Transform.
